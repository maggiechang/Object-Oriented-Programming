I left the adjacent method, distanceSquared method, and clamp method in the Functions.java file. I left these in here because they were used several times in other classes. Also, these methods did not have an object as a parameter so I just left them in the Functions.java file. 

Classes that could be in multiple places:

1) executeAnimationAction(), executeAction(), and executeActivityAction() all could have been in EventScheduler but I put them in Action.java since they are action methods.
2) nextPositionMiner(), executeMinerFullActivity(), executeMinerNotFullAvtivity(), executeOreActivity(), executeOreBlobActivity(), executeQuakeActivity(), executeVeinActivity(), moveToOreBlob(), nextPositionOreBlob() were all in my Entity class because they involve the entities (blob, ore, vein, etc). Majority of them could have been in EventScheduler or WorldModel too.
